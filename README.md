# SADFL: Spectral Anomaly Detection with adversarial learning in Federated Learning for defending malicious client attacks.
This repository contains PyTorch implementation of the paper: SADFL: Spectral Anomaly Detection with adversarial learning in Federated Learning for defending malicious client attacks.

## Content
The repository contains one jupyter notebook for each benchmark which can be used to re-produce the experiments reported in the paper for that benchmark. The notebooks contain clear instructions on how to run the experiments.

## Data sets
